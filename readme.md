# Aim
This is based on a challenge from [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx), where I am provided with a Figma file and some assets and have to create this full-stack application based on user stories.

# Technologies
**Frontend**
- React.js (CRA)
- Tailwind
- TypeScript
- Zustand (state management)
**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express
- Google Cloud Storage (to store images)

# Figma!

*Note: This Figma file was not created by me but instead by devchallenges.io*
